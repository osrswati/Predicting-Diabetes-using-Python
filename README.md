# Predicting-Diabetes-using-Python

## Context Project
The drive behind this project originates from a personal worry regarding diabetes prevalence within my family. With multiple family members, including my grandmother, mother, and potentially myself, affected by this chronic condition, there's a keen interest in exploring the dataset. This proactive approach aims to comprehend and potentially reduce the risk by investigating publicly accessible data. Through this exploration, the objective is to extract insights that may aid in early detection and the development of preventive measures.

## Dataset
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database available on Kaggle. The dataset contains various health metrics of Pima Indian women, including pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.
